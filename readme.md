## Why?

The open access movement has led to a lot of new journals. It's not always obvious where you should submit your work. This is an attempt to help: a curated and continuously updaetd list of open access journals we know to be reputable. 

## Journal x is not on here, why not?

The list is subjective, and it may be incomplete, but we try to make it comprehensive. If your favourite journal (or the journal you run) is not on here, feel free to leave a comment in the 'issues' (top right of the screen), telling us about the journal and why it should be included.

## Who runs this thing. 

Right now, it's just me (Rob Lanfear)

If you're interested in helping maintain the list, you'll need to be on GitHub. Once you're on GitHub, send me and email and I'll consider adding you as a maintainer. As a maintainer, you'll be able to add and remove journals and information yourself, without going through the issues page.
